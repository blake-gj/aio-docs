# Acetal Homopolymer (Delrin®)

## Overview
Acetal Homopolymer (POM-H), commonly known by the trade name Delrin®, is a highly crystalline engineering thermoplastic characterized by its superior strength, stiffness, and fatigue resistance compared to copolymer variants. This material offers excellent dimensional stability, low friction coefficient, and exceptional machinability. The homopolymer structure provides higher mechanical properties and better fatigue resistance than copolymer acetal, though with slightly lower chemical resistance to strong acids and bases.

The material maintains consistent performance in precision applications and offers outstanding spring properties, making it particularly suitable for snap-fit designs and mechanical components requiring high stiffness and resilience.

## Chemical Resistance
Acetal Homopolymer demonstrates good resistance to many chemicals but shows increased sensitivity to acids compared to copolymer variants.

| Chemical | Resistance Rating | Max Temperature |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Water | Excellent | 85°C (185°F) |
| Weak Acids | Fair | 40°C (104°F) |
| Weak Bases | Good | 50°C (122°F) |
| Alcohols | Excellent | 85°C (185°F) |
| Aliphatic Hydrocarbons | Excellent | 85°C (185°F) |

*Rating Scale: Excellent - Material shows no significant degradation after prolonged exposure, Good - Minor effect with limited exposure, Fair - Moderate effect, material may be suitable for short-term exposure, Poor - Significant degradation occurs, Not Recommended - Material is unsuitable for any exposure*

## Design Considerations
- Design with uniform wall thickness whenever possible
- Typical shrinkage rate range: 0.020-0.025 in/in
- Include adequate draft angles for molded parts
- Minimum recommended wall thickness: 1.5mm (0.060")
- Use appropriate radii to prevent stress concentration
- Consider creep behavior under sustained loads
- Excellent for snap-fit and spring applications

## Common Applications
- Precision gears and bearings
- Spring elements and snap-fits
- High-performance mechanical components
- Pump and valve components
- Conveyor system parts
- Food processing equipment
- Consumer product components

## Compliance and Certifications
- FDA compliant grades available (natural color)
- RoHS compliant
- REACH compliant
- NSF compliant grades available
- USP Class VI certified grades available

## Storage and Handling
- Store in a clean, dry environment
- Protect from direct sunlight
- Keep in sealed packaging until use
- Pre-dry if exposed to moisture (82°C for 2-4 hours)
- Handle with clean gloves to prevent contamination
- Maintain proper inventory rotation
- Store away from heat sources
