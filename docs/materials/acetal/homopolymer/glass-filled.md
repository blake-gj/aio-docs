# Glass-Filled Acetal Homopolymer

## Overview
Glass-Filled Acetal Homopolymer combines the high strength and stiffness of POM-H with glass fiber reinforcement, typically available in 20-30% glass fiber content. This engineering composite delivers superior mechanical properties compared to unfilled homopolymer, including enhanced strength, rigidity, and dimensional stability. The addition of glass fibers significantly improves the material's resistance to creep and reduces thermal expansion, making it ideal for structural applications requiring tight tolerances.

The material maintains the excellent machining characteristics of standard homopolymer acetal while providing substantially improved mechanical performance. The glass reinforcement creates an anisotropic structure that requires special consideration in design and processing.

## Design Considerations
- Account for anisotropic behavior due to fiber orientation
- Design with uniform wall thickness to ensure consistent properties
- Typical shrinkage rate range: 0.003-0.005 in/in (parallel to flow)
- Typical shrinkage rate range: 0.008-0.012 in/in (perpendicular to flow)
- Minimum recommended wall thickness: 2.5mm (0.100")
- Use larger radii than with unfilled grades to prevent fiber exposure
- Consider fiber orientation in critical stress areas
- Allow for increased tool wear in machining operations
- Design for proper gate location in molded parts
- Account for reduced impact strength in critical areas
- Consider thermal expansion differences in assembly
