# Acetal Material Guide

## Overview
Acetal, also known as polyoxymethylene (POM), is a highly crystalline engineering thermoplastic known for its excellent dimensional stability, low friction coefficient, and good wear resistance. Available in both homopolymer (POM-H) and copolymer (POM-C) variants, acetal combines high strength and stiffness with excellent machinability, making it a versatile material for precision engineering applications.

Acetal's unique combination of mechanical properties, fatigue resistance, and chemical stability has made it a preferred choice for mechanical components in various industries, from automotive to consumer products. Its low moisture absorption and excellent spring properties make it particularly suitable for precision parts and snap-fit assemblies.

## Material Variants
Acetal is available in two primary forms:
- Homopolymer (POM-H, Delrin®)
- Copolymer (POM-C)

Each type offers modified grades including:
- Glass-filled variants (20-30%)
- PTFE-filled grades
- Anti-static/conductive formulations
- UV-stabilized versions
