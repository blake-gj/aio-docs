# Anti-Static Acetal Copolymer (POM-C)

## Overview
Anti-Static Acetal Copolymer is an engineered variant of standard POM-C that incorporates permanent anti-static additives throughout the polymer matrix. This modification maintains the excellent mechanical properties of base acetal copolymer while providing consistent electrostatic dissipative properties. The material offers controlled electrical conductivity to prevent static charge buildup, making it ideal for applications where static discharge could damage sensitive components or create safety hazards.

This grade combines the dimensional stability, low friction, and wear resistance of standard acetal copolymer with reliable static dissipation capabilities. The anti-static properties are permanent and non-migrating, ensuring consistent performance throughout the part's lifetime, even after repeated cleaning or surface wear.

## Design Considerations
- Maintain uniform wall thickness to ensure consistent electrical properties
- Typical shrinkage rate range: 0.020-0.024 in/in
- Minimum recommended wall thickness: 2.5mm (0.100")
- Use generous radii to prevent stress concentration
- Consider effects of temperature and humidity on electrical properties
- Design parts to maintain electrical continuity where required

## Common Applications
- Electronic component handling trays
- Clean room equipment components
- Semiconductor processing equipment
- Conveyor components for electronic assembly
- Anti-static bearing components
- Material handling equipment for sensitive electronics
- Automation equipment in ESD-sensitive environments

## Compliance and Certifications
- RoHS compliant
- REACH compliant
- ESD compliance per ANSI/ESD S20.20
- Available in custom grades meeting specific ESD requirements

## Storage and Handling
- Store in sealed packaging in a clean, dry environment
- Maintain storage temperature below 40°C (104°F)
- Pre-dry if exposed to moisture (80°C for 2-4 hours)
- Handle with clean gloves to prevent surface contamination
- Avoid exposure to conductive dusts and fibers
- Regular cleaning may be required to maintain optimal static dissipative properties
