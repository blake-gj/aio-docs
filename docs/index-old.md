# Mathematical Equations Example

## Inline Math
When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
\(x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}\)

## Block Math
The quadratic formula is:

$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}
$$

## Engineering Examples

The stress-strain relationship:

$$
\sigma = E\epsilon
$$

The deflection of a beam:

$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{M}{EI}
$$

Where:

- \(E\) is Young's modulus
- \(I\) is the moment of inertia
- \(M\) is the bending moment
