# PTFE-Filled Acetal Homopolymer (Delrin AF)

## Overview
PTFE-Filled Acetal Homopolymer (Delrin AF) is a modified version of POM-H incorporating PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) particles, typically in concentrations of 15-20%. This engineering composite combines the structural strength of acetal homopolymer with the enhanced lubricity and wear resistance of PTFE. The material offers significantly reduced friction coefficients and improved wear characteristics while maintaining good mechanical properties, making it ideal for bearing and wear applications.

The uniform distribution of PTFE throughout the polymer matrix provides consistent performance and self-lubricating properties, even as the surface wears. This makes it particularly suitable for applications requiring low friction and wear resistance without external lubrication.
