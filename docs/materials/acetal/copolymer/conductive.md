# Conductive Acetal Copolymer (POM-C)

## Overview
Conductive Acetal Copolymer is a specially formulated variant of POM-C that incorporates conductive additives throughout the polymer matrix to achieve high electrical conductivity. This engineering thermoplastic maintains many of the desirable mechanical properties of standard acetal copolymer while providing permanent electrical conductivity. The material offers consistent electrical properties throughout the entire component, not just surface conductivity, making it suitable for applications requiring reliable static discharge and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding.

The conductive properties are achieved through a uniform distribution of carbon-based additives, resulting in a stable electrical conductivity that persists even after machining, wear, or surface abrasion. This material bridges the gap between standard engineering plastics and metal components in applications requiring electrical conductivity combined with the processing advantages of thermoplastics.

*Rating Scale: Excellent - Material shows no significant degradation after prolonged exposure, Good - Minor effect with limited exposure, Fair - Moderate effect, material may be suitable for short-term exposure, Poor - Significant degradation occurs, Not Recommended - Material is unsuitable for any exposure*

## Design Considerations
- Design for uniform wall thickness to ensure consistent electrical properties
- Typical shrinkage rate range: 0.022-0.026 in/in
- Minimum recommended wall thickness: 3.0mm (0.120")
- Include generous radii to prevent stress concentration
- Consider effects of operating environment on conductivity
- Design parts to maintain electrical continuity through contact points
- Account for reduced mechanical properties compared to standard acetal

## Common Applications
- EMI shielding components
- Electrical housings and enclosures
- Static discharge components
- Fuel system components
- Electronics assembly fixtures
- Grounding components
- Semiconductor processing equipment
- Equipment for explosive environments

## Compliance and Certifications
- RoHS compliant
- REACH compliant
- UL 94 HB rated
- Available in custom grades meeting specific conductivity requirements
- ATEX compliance available for specific grades

## Storage and Handling
- Store in sealed packaging in a clean, dry environment
- Maintain storage temperature below 40°C (104°F)
- Pre-dry if exposed to moisture (75°C for 3-4 hours)
- Handle with clean gloves to prevent surface contamination
- Protect from strong oxidizing environments
- Regular cleaning may be required to maintain optimal conductivity
- Avoid contact with oils and greases that may affect surface conductivity
