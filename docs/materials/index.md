# Materials Library

## Overview
The Aeromat.io materials library provides comprehensive technical data and engineering guidance for performance plastics. Each material page is structured to support informed decision-making in design, sourcing, and manufacturing processes.

## Material Data Pages

Every material entry includes:
- Physical and mechanical properties with ASTM test methods
- Thermal and electrical characteristics
- Chemical resistance data
- Design considerations and limitations
- Processing guidelines
- Compliance and certification information
- Storage and handling requirements

## Data Usage

While we maintain high standards for accuracy, material properties can vary between manufacturers and grades. The data provided represents typical values and should be used for initial material selection and general engineering guidance. Critical applications should always verify specific grade properties with the material manufacturer.

Material performance can be significantly affected by:
- Processing conditions
- Environmental factors
- Operating temperature
- Chemical exposure
- Loading conditions
- Part geometry
