# Acetal Copolymer (POM-C)

## Overview
Acetal Copolymer (POM-C) is a highly crystalline engineering thermoplastic characterized by its excellent dimensional stability, low friction coefficient, and good wear resistance. The copolymer structure provides enhanced resistance to thermal and chemical degradation compared to homopolymer acetal, particularly in terms of hydrolysis resistance. This material is widely used in precision parts that require high stiffness and excellent fatigue resistance.

The material maintains consistent performance across a broad range of operating conditions and offers excellent machinability, making it suitable for both injection molded parts and machined components.

| Chemical | Resistance Rating | Max Temperature |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Water | Excellent | 82°C (180°F) |
| Weak Acids | Good | 50°C (122°F) |
| Weak Bases | Good | 50°C (122°F) |
| Alcohols | Excellent | 82°C (180°F) |
| Aliphatic Hydrocarbons | Excellent | 82°C (180°F) |

*Rating Scale: Excellent - Material shows no significant degradation after prolonged exposure, Good - Minor effect with limited exposure, Fair - Moderate effect, material may be suitable for short-term exposure, Poor - Significant degradation occurs, Not Recommended - Material is unsuitable for any exposure*

## Design Considerations
- Design with uniform wall thickness whenever possible
- Include adequate draft angles for molded parts
- Typical shrinkage rate range: 0.018-0.022 in/in
- Avoid sharp corners; use appropriate radii
- Consider moisture absorption in precision applications

## Common Applications
- Bearing components and bushings
- Gears and mechanical components
- Precision parts requiring dimensional stability
- Food processing equipment components
- Pump and valve components

## Compliance and Certifications
- FDA compliant grades available (natural color)
- RoHS compliant
- USP Class VI certified grades available

## Storage and Handling
- Store in a clean, dry environment
- Protect from direct sunlight
- Keep in sealed packaging until use
- Pre-dry if exposed to moisture (typical conditions: 80°C for 2-4 hours)
- Handle with clean gloves to prevent surface contamination
