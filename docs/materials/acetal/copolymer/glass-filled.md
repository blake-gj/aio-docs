# Glass-Filled Acetal Copolymer (POM-C)

## Overview
Glass-Filled Acetal Copolymer combines the base properties of POM-C with glass fiber reinforcement, typically available in 20-30% glass fiber content variations. This engineering composite offers enhanced mechanical properties, including higher strength, stiffness, and dimensional stability compared to unfilled acetal copolymer. The addition of glass fibers also improves the material's resistance to creep and reduces thermal expansion, making it particularly suitable for structural applications requiring precise tolerances.

The material maintains many of the desirable characteristics of standard acetal copolymer, such as chemical resistance and good machinability, while providing superior mechanical performance. The glass reinforcement creates an anisotropic structure that must be considered in both design and processing stages.

*Rating Scale: Excellent - Material shows no significant degradation after prolonged exposure, Good - Minor effect with limited exposure, Fair - Moderate effect, material may be suitable for short-term exposure, Poor - Significant degradation occurs, Not Recommended - Material is unsuitable for any exposure*

## Design Considerations
- Account for anisotropic behavior due to fiber orientation
- Design with uniform wall thickness to ensure consistent properties
- Typical shrinkage rate range: 0.003-0.005 in/in (parallel to flow)
- Minimum recommended wall thickness: 2.5mm (0.100")
- Use larger radii than with unfilled grades to prevent fiber exposure
- Consider fiber orientation in critical stress areas
- Allow for increased tool wear in machining operations

## Common Applications
- Structural components requiring high stiffness
- Precision mechanical parts
- High-load bearing components
- Gear wheels and cams
- Pump and valve components
- Industrial automation components
- Automotive under-hood components
- Heavy-duty bushings and bearings

## Compliance and Certifications
- RoHS compliant
- REACH compliant
- UL 94 HB rated
- FDA compliant grades available (natural color)
- Custom grades available for specific industry requirements

## Storage and Handling
- Store in sealed packaging in a clean, dry environment
- Protect from direct sunlight and moisture
- Pre-dry if exposed to moisture (80°C for 3-4 hours)
- Handle with clean gloves to prevent surface contamination
- Use appropriate dust collection when machining
- Store away from heat sources
- Maintain proper inventory rotation
